An efficient blocker: easy on memory and CPU footprint, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.

Usage: The big power button in the popup is to permanently disable/enable µBlock for the current web site. It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.

Flexible, it's more than an "ad blocker": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.

Out of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:

- EasyList
- EasyPrivacy
- Malware domains
- Long-lived malware domains
- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list
- Malware Domains List

More lists are available for you to select if you wish:

- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List
- Dan Pollock’s hosts file
- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers
- MVPS HOSTS
- Spam404
- Etc.

Of course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, µBlock still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.

Since the review area does not allow the author to answer, with this project I decided to answer through the project's home site, so hopefully this will be of some help to answer question, or correct inaccuracies (which may also occur in good reviews):

Without the preset lists of filters, this extension is nothing. So if ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.
