# µBlock experimental
# Experimental list: use only if you don't mind potential breakage, I just
# don't have the resource to deal with lists, I do it because blocking these
# are in the interest of users.
#
# I will use data from benchmarks to decide what to add here.

# CAVEAT: There are so many exception filters in EasyList, EasyPrivacy and 
# Fanboy's lists that it's just impossible to guarantee that whatever I put in 
# "µBlock filters - Privacy" will actually be enforced with a 100% certainty.
#
# The only way for sure you can block something is to install and use 
# HTTP Switchboard. If you don't like to break sites, I suggest you start in 
# allow-all/block-exceptionally mode and blacklist whatever you wish as you go.
# 
# You may want to read more also about the latest release of HTTP Switchboard 
# if you plan to install it alongside µBlock (suggested).
