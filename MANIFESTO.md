### This is µBlock's manifesto

1. The **user decides** what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.

The µBlock project does not support Adblock Plus' _"Acceptable Ads Manifesto"_, 
because the slick _"Acceptable Ads"_ marketing campaign is really the business 
plan of a for-profit company.

The µBlock project will not let itself be used as a tool to boost the revenues 
of a for-profit entity through the support of the _"Acceptable Ads"_ marketing 
campaign.

Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. µBlock's 
sole purpose is to give users the mean to enforce their own choices.
